Analysis of Dijkstra’s Algorithm
• Graph operations
->incidentEdges is called once for each v
• Label operations
->We set/get the distance and locator labels of vertex z, O(deg(z)) times
->Setting/getting a label takes O(1) time
• Priority queue operations
->Each v is inserted once into and removed once from the PQ, where each insertion or removal takes O(log n) time  total nO(log n) 
->The key of a vertex in the PQ is modified at most deg(v) times, where each key change takes O(log n) time
• Dijkstra’s algorithm runs in O((n + m) log n) time provided the graph is represented by the adjacency list structure
->Recall that Sv deg(v) = 2m
• The running time can also be expressed as O(m log n) since the graph is connected

O((n + m) log n)
O(m log n)
