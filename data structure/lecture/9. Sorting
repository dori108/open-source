Sorting-Review

• Sequential methods:
• Insertion Sort
• Other similar algorithms: selection sort, bubble sort

• Divide-and-conquer methods
  • Merge sort
    • Divide the data into two halves
    • Recur for each half until there one or less element
    • Merge the sorted halves returned from recursion
  • Quick sort
    • Choose a pivot x (usually, the first or last element is chosen)
    • Divide the data into L, E, G subsets
    • L: less than pivot, E: equal to pivot, G: greater than pivot
    • Recur for L and G
    • Merge as (L, E, G)
